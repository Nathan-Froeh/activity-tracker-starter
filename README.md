# Fit Lit

A project based on the FitBit app has a data supply for 50 users and include 100 days worth of information about their hydration, sleep, and fitness paterns. The goal was to get comfortable with data manipulation, Object Oriented Programming, and Test Driven Development as well as come up with our own site design and layout. On page load a new user is loaded with their stats for the current day and the past week in the hydration, sleep, and activity widgets and there is a step challenge between the current user and 4 of his or her friends.

The details of this project are outlined in [this project spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/activity-tracker.html).

Check out our project page [here](https://nathan-froeh.github.io/activity-tracker-starter/).

We sucessfully completed all 5 iterations and decided to try to integrate charts.js into our project as an extention.
